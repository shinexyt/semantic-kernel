**Semantic Kernel (SK)** is a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large
Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. The SK extensible
programming model combines natural language **semantic functions**, traditional
code **native functions**, and **embeddings-based memory** unlocking new potential
and adding value to applications with AI.

SK supports
[prompt templating](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/prompt-engineering/prompt-template-syntax), function
chaining,
[vectorized memory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/embeddings), and
[intelligent planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner)
capabilities out of the box.

Semantic Kernel supports and encapsulates several design patterns from the latest
in AI research, such that developers can infuse their applications with [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins) like [prompt
chaining](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions), recursive reasoning, summarization, zero/few-shot learning, contextual
memory, long-term memory, [embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/embeddings), semantic indexing,
[planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), retrieval-augmented generation and accessing external
knowledge stores as well as your own data.

By joining the SK community, you can build AI-first apps faster and have a front-row
peek at how the SDK is being built. SK has been released as open-source so that more
pioneering developers can join us in crafting the future of this landmark moment
in the history of computing.

## Get Started with Semantic Kernel ⚡

Semantic Kernel is available to explore AI and build apps with C#, Python and Java:

See the [Feature Matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/supported-languages) to see a breakdown of feature parity between our currently supported languages.

The quickest way to get started with the basics is to get an API key
(OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
and to run one of the C#, Python, and Java console applications/scripts:

### For C#:

1. Create a new console app.
2. Add the semantic kernel nuget `Microsoft.SemanticKernel`.
3. Copy the code from [here](dotnet/README.md) into the app `Program.cs` file.
4. Replace the configuration placeholders for API key and other params with your key and settings.
5. Run with `F5` or `dotnet run`

### For Python:

1. Install the pip package: `python -m pip install semantic-kernel`.
2. Create a new script e.g. `hello-world.py`.
3. Store your API key and settings in an `.env` file as described [here](python/README.md).
4. Copy the code from [here](python/README.md) into the `hello-world.py` script.
5. Run the python script.

### For Java:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git`
2. Switch to `semantic-kernel` directory and then checkout experimental Java branch: `git checkout experimental-java`
3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/experimental-java/java/samples/sample-code/README.md)

## Sample apps ⚡

The repository includes some sample applications, with a React frontend and
a backend web service using Semantic Kernel.

Follow the links for more information and instructions about running these apps.
